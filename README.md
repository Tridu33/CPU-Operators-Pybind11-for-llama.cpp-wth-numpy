# LlamacppCpuOpsPybinder
Inspired by ktransformers, we explore CPU Operators from llama.cpp to Python Script by Pybind11 with data interaction via numpy, like ktransformers as a Dynamic-link library `cpuinfer.so` for Heterogeneous computing on MacOS(Apple silicon)、Linux(aarch64/arm64)、Windows. 

What if exploring llama.cpp's Ops by Android NDK(ndk-build) and finally used in Android, called by Java JNI？
